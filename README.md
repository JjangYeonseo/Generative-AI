Yes, you can create a system to automatically generate detailed prompts for ChatGPT based on specific keywords or simple content. To achieve this, you would typically use a combination of a natural language processing model, such as ChatGPT itself, and some programming to handle the keyword detection and prompt generation.

Hereâ€™s a basic example using Python, where you can modify the code to suit your specific requirements:

### **Setup**

1.  **Install Dependencies**: You need to have `openai` Python package installed for interacting with ChatGPT API. You can install it using pip:
    
    ```bash
    pip install openai
    ```
    
2.  **API Key**: Make sure you have your OpenAI API key ready.
    

### **Example Code**

This example code defines a function to generate detailed prompts based on input keywords. You can customize the keyword-to-prompt mapping as needed.

```python

import openai

# Set up your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'

def generate_detailed_prompt(keyword):
    """
    Generate a detailed prompt based on a given keyword.
    """
    # Define keyword-to-prompt mappings
    prompts = {
        'tech': "You are an expert in technology. Explain the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and how they impact everyday life.",
        'health': "You are a healthcare specialist. Describe the most effective strategies for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and managing chronic diseases.",
        'education': "You are an educator. Discuss the benefits and challenges of online learning compared to traditional classroom education.",
        'finance': "You are a financial advisor. Provide insights into effective personal finance management and investment strategies for beginners."
    }
    
    # Default prompt if keyword not found
    default_prompt = "Please provide more details or choose a specific topic."

    # Get the detailed prompt based on the keyword
    prompt = prompts.get(keyword.lower(), default_prompt)
    
    return prompt

def get_chatgpt_response(prompt):
    """
    Get a response from ChatGPT based on the generated prompt.
    """
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-4",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example usage
keyword = 'tech'  # This would be dynamically set in a real application
detailed_prompt = generate_detailed_prompt(keyword)
response = get_chatgpt_response(detailed_prompt)

print("Generated Prompt:")
print(detailed_prompt)
print("\nChatGPT Response:")
print(response)
```

### **How This Works**

1.  **Keyword-to-Prompt Mapping**:
    
    *   The `generate_detailed_prompt` function maps keywords to predefined detailed prompts. You can expand this dictionary based on the topics you want to cover.
2.  **Get Response from ChatGPT**:
    
    *   The `get_chatgpt_response` function sends the generated prompt to the OpenAI API and retrieves the response.
3.  **Example Usage**:
    
    *   You can test the script with different keywords, and it will generate a corresponding detailed prompt and fetch the response from ChatGPT.

### **Customization**

1.  **Expand Keyword Mappings**:
    
    *   Add more keywords and corresponding detailed prompts to the `prompts` dictionary based on your needs.
2.  **Integrate with User Input**:
    
    *   If you want to use user input to set the `keyword`, you can modify the script to read input from the command line or a web interface.
3.  **Handle Special Cases**:
    
    *   Implement more sophisticated prompt generation if needed, based on the complexity of the keywords or context.

This setup provides a basic framework for generating detailed prompts dynamically. You can build upon this to fit your specific use case, whether it's integrating into a larger application or refining the prompt generation logic.
