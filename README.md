# Generative-AI

I can create a system to automatically generate detailed prompts for ChatGPT based on specific keywords or simple content. 
To achieve this, I would typically use a combination of a natural language processing model, such as ChatGPT itself, and some programming to handle the keyword detection and prompt generation.

#How This Works

##Keyword-to-Prompt Mapping:
The generate_detailed_prompt function maps keywords to predefined detailed prompts. 
I can expand this dictionary based on the topics I want to cover.

##Get Response from ChatGPT:
The get_chatgpt_response function sends the generated prompt to the OpenAI API and retrieves the response.

##Example Usage:
I can test the script with different keywords, and it will generate a corresponding detailed prompt and fetch the response from ChatGPT.

#Customization

##Expand Keyword Mappings:
Add more keywords and corresponding detailed prompts to the prompts dictionary based on my needs.

##Integrate with User Input:
If I want to use user input to set the keyword, I can modify the script to read input from the command line or a web interface.

##Handle Special Cases:
Implement more sophisticated prompt generation if needed, based on the complexity of the keywords or context.
This setup provides a basic framework for generating detailed prompts dynamically. I can build upon this to fit my specific use case, whether it's integrating into a larger application or refining the prompt generation logic.
